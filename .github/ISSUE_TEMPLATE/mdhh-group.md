HI THERE I'M
MD HAISAM HOQUE
As a front-end developer, my job is to create beautiful and functional websites that users will love. I'm responsible for the visual and interactive aspects of a website, which means I need to be skilled in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
In addition to coding, I also work closely with designers to bring their vision to life. This means translating their designs into functional code, while also making suggestions for improvements based on my technical expertise.
As a front-end developer, I'm constantly learning and keeping up with the latest technologies and trends. This allows me to create websites that are both visually stunning and cutting-edge in terms of functionality. I take pride in my work and strive to create websites that not only look great, but also provide a great user experience for everyone who visits them.
